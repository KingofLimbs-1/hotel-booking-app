## Database Setup

Prerequisites
Before setting up the database, ensure that you have the following installed:

- XAMPP or MAMP for creating a local server environment.
- Visual Studio Code for code editing.

### <ins>Steps to Set Up the Database</ins>

1. #### Clone the Repository:

Clone this project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. #### Start XAAMP/MAMP:

   Open XAMPP or MAMP and start the Apache and MySQL services. This will create a local server environment to run your application.

3. #### Import the database:

Locate the SQL copy of the database (library.sql) in the project directory. Use a tool like phpMyAdmin or the command line to import the database into your local MySQL server.

- #### Using phpMyAdmin:

- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
- Create a new database with a suitable name.
- In the newly created database, navigate to the "Import" tab.
- Choose the SQL file (your-database.sql) and click "Go" to import the database.

- #### Using Command Line:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory containing 'hotel-reservation-system.sql'.

Run the following command to import the database:

```
mysql -u root -p your_database_name < db_name.sql
```

- You will be prompted to enter your MySQL password.

4. #### Configure Connection:

1. In your project codebase, open the file where the database connection details are stored. This is in the config/database.php file.

1. Create a new config.php file in the root directory of the project, and add the following code, replacing placeholders with your own credentials:

```
<?php
define("DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("DB_USERNAME", "your_username");
define("DB_PASSWORD", "your_password");
define("DB_NAME", "your_database_name");
?>
```

3. Save the 'config.php' file.

4. In the project codebase, look for the database.php file where the connection is established. Require the config.php file by adding this line at the beginning:

```
require_once(__DIR__ . '/config.php');
```

5. #### Test the Application:

Start your application in the local server environment provided by XAMPP/MAMP. Access the application in your web browser and verify that it is connected to the local database.
